# Azure Functions Starters

These are three opinionated starting points for creating an Azure Function App in Go, Python or TypeScript.

They go beyond the simple code you will get from `func init` `func new` template and start to introduce structure to the project (i.e. not all code in a single file!), linters, Dockerfile for building and deploying etc.

The Go example is using Functions Custom Handlers and has it's own readme
